To run the file with data from text files run it like this:
./Lab03 data2.txt

Observations:

For the most part, if an insertion fails, it fails with both hash tables.
One exception is values that are a multiple of the table size (53, 106, etc)
Sometimes these will fail on both, other times they only fail on the quadratic
probing table. In general, the double hashing table is more successful at
inserting values
