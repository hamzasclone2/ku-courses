Project 2 Report

The way that I made my project work is like this:

1. Rank 0 sends rgb values of each image to each rank using Isend. This is because Rank 0 does not need to make sure that any of the other processes have received their data in order to begin working on its own data.

2. After receiving their data, each rank (including Rank 0), calculates the percentages of its values.

3. Then an Allgather is used so each process receives all of the info of each other process into one buffer. Each rank waits until it receives all the data. 

4. Then each rank compares its values to the rest of the ranks, and determines which image it is most similar to.

5. Then all the ranks use a Gather to get their info back to just Rank 0. This is because only Rank 0 will be outputting. Rank 0 waits until it has received all the values.

6. Rank 0 outputs the final answers to the console, after receiving all the values.
