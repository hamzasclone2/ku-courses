HOW TO RUN

Just call python barGraph.py in the terminal 

INSTRUCTIONS

This program lets you make a very basic sideways bar graph
in the terminal.To start go to Create New Data to make your 
first bar. From there you can change it, make more, delete a 
bar, or make thegraph itself. You can also keep 
changing/deleting after you've generated a graph. Couple 
things, python is relatively new to me so there's not really any 
error handling, so make sure you type strings when you need 
to, and numbers when you need to. The entire thing runs in 
the terminal so I would suggest making it full screen. I don't 
know if terminals can normally scroll right, but if thats not 
possible then just stick with keeping values less than 180 ish.
